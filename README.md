## Question
If I make a **fork** of a repository and then modify the code, will my changes affect the original repository?

---

## Answer
No, **your changes will not affect the original repository**.

When you fork a repository, GitHub creates a **separate and independent copy** of that repository under your own account. Any changes you make—such as editing files, committing code, or pushing updates—apply **only to your fork**.

The original repository remains unchanged.
